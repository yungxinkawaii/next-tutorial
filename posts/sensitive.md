My favorite topic lately: **sensitive people**. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they're all bad or anything. It's just that I can't deal with their constant need for attention and their tendency to get offended over every little thing (like **EVERY THING**).

Like, seriously, I just can't relate to their insecurities. It's like they're always on the lookout for reasons to be upset, and it's just exhausting.

I get it, everyone has different emotional needs, but for me personally, I just can't deal with overly sensitive people. They're too much of a hassle, and it's hard to have a real relationship with them because you're always worried about saying or doing the wrong thing. (Tho idgaf, man, idgaf at all)

Have fun being sensitive folks! and leave me alone thanks.
