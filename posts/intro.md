Yo. I'm just a **software engineering** student trying to figure out where I fit in the tech world. I've been messing around with **backend development** and dabbling in some blockchain & Web3 technology through various hackathons and programs.

But to be honest, I still have no idea what I want to do with my life. All I know is that I want to live a chill life and find some peace before I hit 60.

Anyway, I'm still excited to learn new things and hopefully find my place in this crazy industry. I think my diverse experiences will bring a fresh perspective to any project or team, so hit me up if you need a guy like me on your team. (Find me if you can :P)
