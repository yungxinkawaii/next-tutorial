title: 'Why Web3?'

I mean, sure, there's a ton of hype around blockchain and all that jazz, but honestly, the more I learn about it, the more I'm like, meh.

First of all, everyone and their mom seems to be trying to cash in on this blockchain stuff. It's like, can we all just calm down and focus on something that actually matters?

And don't even get me started on how confusing and clunky a lot of these web3 platforms are. Like, I get that decentralization is supposed to be a good thing, but does it have to be so darn inconvenient?

Oh, and let's not forget about the whole environmental impact of it all. Like, seriously, we're wasting so much energy and resources on something that might not even be all that useful in the end.

Look, I'm not saying web3 is a complete bust. I'm sure there are some cool applications out there, but for me, it's just not my jam right now. I'd rather put my energy into something that feels more fulfilling.

(Please don't expose this to someone who's in the same community as me TT)
